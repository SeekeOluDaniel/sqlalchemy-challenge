# sqlalchemy-challenge Week 10 Assignment

In this homework, the objective was to do a basic climate analysis and exploration of a climate database about Honolulu, Hawaii. 


### Tools
1. SQLAlchemy ORM queries
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Flask


### Analysis

*Step by step processes are provided within the Jupyter notebook.

I set out to:

1. Perform a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis by completing the steps outlined in the climate_starter.ipynb.
2. Design a Flask API based on the queries previously developed in the jupyter notebook.


### References

I had help from a few learning assistants to clarify some concepts and help debug a couple of errors in the app.py file:

1. Lines 86 and 87 [Unravel results into a 1D array and convert to a list]
2. Line 110 [Change the parameter name to align with the variable name used in that section of code] 
3. Line 116 - 120 [Divided the query into two parts for clarity and readability, and used the "strptime" method to parse the date into a "datetime" object]
